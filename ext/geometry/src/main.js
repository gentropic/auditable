// @gcu/geometry — the robust-geometry base of the GCU stack.
//
// What lives here is the geometry every
// other package kept re-implementing:
//
//   BVH        build + ray queries — one copy, instead of one per consumer
//   topology   CSR vertex->vertex and vertex->face adjacency for triangle meshes
//
// Consumers: @gcu/winding (generalized winding number ON @gcu/geometry), @gcu/clar
// (structural geology ON @gcu/geometry), micro. @gcu/peel still carries its own BVH;
// folding it in is the follow-up, once this API has two real consumers proving
// its shape rather than one speculative one.
//
// Zero dependencies. Everything is plain typed arrays — no classes to
// serialize, so a BVH or an adjacency crosses a worker boundary by transfer.

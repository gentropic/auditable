// @gcu/clar — plane fitting by principal component analysis of vertex POSITIONS.
//
// This is a total-least-squares fit: the plane that minimizes the sum of squared
// perpendicular distances to a set of points. It is NOT an average of face
// normals, and the difference matters — averaging normals weights by however the
// mesh happens to be triangulated, while the position fit weights by where the
// rock actually is.
//
//     T = (1/n) Σ (xᵢ - x̄)(xᵢ - x̄)ᵀ        the covariance, mean-centered
//     [values, vectors] = symmetricEigen3(T)   descending
//     normal = vectors[2]                      the SMALLEST eigenvalue's axis
//
// The eigenvalues are the dispersion measure, and they come out in squared
// length units: e0 and e1 span the patch, e2 is the variance perpendicular to
// the fitted plane, so `sqrt(e2)` is the RMS distance from the plane. A patch
// that is genuinely planar has e2 ≈ 0, and the ratio e2/e1 is the quality
// number to filter on.
//
// ── The mean-centering is load-bearing, twice ──
//
// Mathematically: @gcu/bearing already has an `orientationTensor(dcos)` which
// does NOT mean-center, because it is built for unit direction cosines where the
// origin is meaningful. Feed positions to that one and the leading eigenvector
// comes back pointing at the centroid rather than along the plane — a fit that is
// wrong and looks entirely plausible. Hence the deliberately different name here.
//
// Numerically: outcrop coordinates are UTM, so x ≈ 5e5 and x² ≈ 2.5e11. Float64
// carries ~16 significant digits, so accumulating raw squares would spend six of
// them representing an offset we are about to subtract. Both passes below work
// in coordinates shifted to the first point, which keeps every accumulated
// quantity the size of the patch rather than the size of the projection.

 * here, it delegates to @gcu/bearing, and it is round-trip tested.
 *
 * The input basis is **x = East, y = North, z = Up**, which is what micro's world
 * coordinates and bearing's direction cosines both already use, so the basis
 * change is the identity — stated once and verified, rather than assumed
 * everywhere. Either sign of the normal gives the same answer: `dcosToPlane`
 * folds the vector into the lower hemisphere itself.

//
// The second condition is the one that does the real work. A pure radius query

// between two beds that happen to pass close in space; requiring connectivity
// keeps a stroke on the surface the geologist is actually looking at. It is also
// what makes the brush behave the way a brush should — paint spreads from where
// you touched, and stops at an edge.
//
// The cylinder is built on the view ray rather than a sphere at the hit point
// because that is what the cursor means on screen: everything under this circle,
// at whatever depth. Depth along the ray is deliberately unbounded — the BFS,

//
// Once traces are digitized, the network's connectivity is read off the nodes
// where traces meet, classified by how many branches arrive:
//
//   I   degree 1   a free end — the trace stops in intact rock
//   Y   degree 3   an abutment — one trace terminates against another
//   X   degree 4   a crossing — two traces cut through each other
//
// Degree 2 is not a node at all, just a point along a trace, and is excluded.
// Degrees of 5 and above are geometrically possible but usually mean two nodes
// digitized on top of each other; they are counted and reported rather than
// quietly folded into X, because a silent reclassification would move the
// connectivity numbers without saying so.
//
// CAPIVARAS stopped at the classification — `updateTopology()` literally returned
// the set, and status.txt recorded that the real analysis "tá no jupyter", in a
// notebook outside the repo that never came home. The derived quantities below
// are the rest of it, and they are four lines of arithmetic:

// saturated corners of the RGB cube. Photogrammetry texture colors are essentially
// never exactly saturated, so this cleanly separates "painted by a human" from
// "photographed", with no threshold to tune.
//
// "Exactly" is relaxed to a tolerance because the round trip through 8-bit .ply

// half a step of 8-bit quantization, which admits genuine paint and still
// excludes any real photographic color.

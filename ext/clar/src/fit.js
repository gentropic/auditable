// @gcu/clar — plane fitting by principal component analysis of vertex POSITIONS.
//
// This is a total-least-squares fit: the plane that minimizes the sum of squared
// perpendicular distances to a set of points. It is NOT an average of face
// normals, and the difference matters — averaging normals weights by however the
// mesh happens to be triangulated, while the position fit weights by where the
// rock actually is.
//
//     T = (1/n) Σ (xᵢ - x̄)(xᵢ - x̄)ᵀ        the covariance, mean-centered
//     [values, vectors] = symmetricEigen3(T)   descending
//     normal = vectors[2]                      the SMALLEST eigenvalue's axis
//
// The eigenvalues are the dispersion measure, and they come out in squared
// length units: e0 and e1 span the patch, e2 is the variance perpendicular to
// the fitted plane, so `sqrt(e2)` is the RMS distance from the plane. A patch
// that is genuinely planar has e2 ≈ 0, and the ratio e2/e1 is the quality
// number to filter on.
//
// ── The mean-centering is load-bearing, twice ──
//
// Mathematically: @gcu/bearing already has an `orientationTensor(dcos)` which
// does NOT mean-center, because it is built for unit direction cosines where the
// origin is meaningful. Feed positions to that one and the leading eigenvector
// comes back pointing at the centroid rather than along the plane — a fit that is
// wrong and looks entirely plausible. Hence the deliberately different name here.
//
// Numerically: outcrop coordinates are UTM, so x ≈ 5e5 and x² ≈ 2.5e11. Float64
// carries ~16 significant digits, so accumulating raw squares would spend six of
// them representing an offset we are about to subtract. Both passes below work
// in coordinates shifted to the first point, which keeps every accumulated
// quantity the size of the patch rather than the size of the projection.

// @gcu/clar — reading plane sets back out of vertex colors (ply2atti compat).
//
// The established workflow this replaces is: paint the outcrop mesh in MeshLab
// with saturated primary colors, one color per joint set, export .ply, run
// ply2atti. Anyone with that habit has meshes already painted, and they should
// open here and just work.
//
// The rule is the original's: a vertex belongs to a set if every channel is
// exactly 0 or exactly 1 and the color is not black — that is, one of the seven
// saturated corners of the RGB cube. Photogrammetry texture colors are essentially
// never exactly saturated, so this cleanly separates "painted by a human" from
// "photographed", with no threshold to tune.
//
// "Exactly" is relaxed to a tolerance because the round trip through 8-bit .ply
// and back is exact but a round trip through some editors is not. The default is
// half a step of 8-bit quantization, which admits genuine paint and still
// excludes any real photographic color.

// @gcu/clar — the painting brush.
//
// A brush stroke is the intersection of two conditions:
//
//   geometric    the vertex lies within `radius` of the line through the cursor
//   topological  the vertex is reachable from the seed WITHOUT leaving that
//                cylinder — a breadth-first walk of the surface, not a range query
//
// The second condition is the one that does the real work. A pure radius query
// would paint through a fracture onto the opposing wall, or across the gap
// between two beds that happen to pass close in space; requiring connectivity
// keeps a stroke on the surface the geologist is actually looking at. It is also
// what makes the brush behave the way a brush should — paint spreads from where
// you touched, and stops at an edge.
//
// The cylinder is built on the view ray rather than a sphere at the hit point
// because that is what the cursor means on screen: everything under this circle,
// at whatever depth. Depth along the ray is deliberately unbounded — the BFS,
// not a near/far clip, decides how far the paint travels.

 * @param {ArrayLike<number>} positions  flat xyz
 * @param {object} [opts]

 *                                       the walk will not cross them
 * @param {number} [opts.limit=Infinity] stop after this many vertices. There is no
 *        default cap: a stroke across a 20-million-vertex model is a legitimate
 *        thing to want, and an invisible ceiling that silently truncates a
 *        measurement is worse than a slow one.
 * @returns {Uint32Array} painted vertex indices, ascending. Always contains the
 *          seed, even if the seed itself sits outside the cylinder — the user
 *          clicked there, so they meant it.

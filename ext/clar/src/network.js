// @gcu/clar — fracture-network topology, the Sanderson & Nixon I/Y/X scheme.
//
// Once traces are digitized, the network's connectivity is read off the nodes
// where traces meet, classified by how many branches arrive:
//
//   I   degree 1   a free end — the trace stops in intact rock
//   Y   degree 3   an abutment — one trace terminates against another
//   X   degree 4   a crossing — two traces cut through each other
//
// Degree 2 is not a node at all, just a point along a trace, and is excluded.
// Degrees of 5 and above are geometrically possible but usually mean two nodes
// digitized on top of each other; they are counted and reported rather than
// quietly folded into X, because a silent reclassification would move the
// connectivity numbers without saying so.
//
// CAPIVARAS stopped at the classification — `updateTopology()` literally returned
// the set, and status.txt recorded that the real analysis "tá no jupyter", in a
// notebook outside the repo that never came home. The derived quantities below
// are the rest of it, and they are four lines of arithmetic:

/**
 * Classify the nodes of a trace network and derive its connectivity.
 *
 * Nodes are identified by vertex index, so two traces meet only where they share
 * an actual mesh vertex. Snapping nearby endpoints together is the host's job,
 * not this function's — proximity is a display-scale decision and does not belong
 * buried in the topology.
 *
 * @param {Array<ArrayLike<number>>} traces  each a polyline of vertex indices
 * @returns {{
 *   nodes: Array<{vertex: number, degree: number, kind: 'I'|'Y'|'X'|'other'}>,
 *   counts: {I: number, Y: number, X: number, other: number},
 *   branches: number, lines: number,
 *   connectivityPerBranch: number, connectivityPerLine: number
